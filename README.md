# Bill Calculator README

## Overview

This Python script calculates the total tip amount and the total bill amount including the tip. Additionally, it splits the bill among a specified number of people and provides the individual bill amount including the tip.

## Features

- Calculate the total tip amount based on the provided bill total and tip percentage.
- Calculate the total bill amount including the tip.
- Split the total bill among a specified number of people.
- Provide the individual bill amount including the tip.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or download the script file.
2. **Ensure Python 3.x is installed**. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Running the Script

1. **Open a terminal** or command prompt.
2. **Navigate to the directory** where the script is located. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/script
   ```
3. **Run the script** by executing the following command:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python3 script_name.py
   ```

## Usage

1. The script will prompt you to enter the bill total. Enter the amount in dollars (e.g., `50.00`).
2. Next, you will be prompted to enter the tip percentage. Enter the percentage as an integer (e.g., for 15%, enter `15`).
3. The script will then calculate and display the total tip amount and the total bill amount including the tip.
4. You will then be prompted to enter the number of ways to split the bill. Enter the number of people to split the bill among (e.g., `3`).
5. The script will calculate and display the individual bill amount including the tip.

## Example

```bash
Enter Bill Total: $ 50.00
Enter tip amount in percentage (e.g. For 15%, enter 15): 15
The total tip is: $ 7.50
The total bill including tip is: $ 57.50
Split the bill how many ways: 3
Your individual bill is $ 19.17 including tip!
```
